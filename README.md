# TRON Basis Cash

Fairly distributed & censorship-resistant stablecoin with an algorithmic central bank

## Abstract

TRON Basis is an algorithmic stablecoin protocol, built on TRON Blockchain, where the money supply is dynamically adjusted to meet changes in money demand.

* When demand is rising, the blockchain will create more TRON Basis Cash. The expanded supply is designed to bring the TRON Basis price back down.
* When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back TRON Basis Cash. The contracted supply is designed to restore TRON Basis price.
* The TRON Basis protocol is designed to expand and contract supply similarly to the way central banks buy and sell the fiscal debt to stabilize purchasing power. For this reason, we refer to TRON Basis Cash as having an algorithmic central bank.

# Distribution Overview

Both TRON Basis Shares and TRON Basis Cash do not have any pre-allocations to neither the founding team, nor any external investors. Shares are instead distributed to community members that perform actions beneficial to the network.

Fair, open distribution of the entire token supply is advantageous to the protocol's long-term success, rewarding those with a stake in the network, instead of investors/speculators targeting short-term profits.

Moreover, distributing $TBS rewards provides a strong financial incentive for network bootstrapping, boosting adoption via network effects. For example, rewards given to TRON Basis Cash liquidity providers prevent TRON Basis Cash from becoming significantly devalued, something that can be detrimental for the network.


## Zero supply minted / purely via community distribution

The initial distribution of TRON Basis Cash prioritizes those who deposit USDT (TRC20), TRX and USDJ to the distribution contract.

* A total of 90,000 $TRC tokens are distributed to depositors, distributed over 7 days. An equal amount of 30,000 $TRC tokens is assigned to each pool.

Afterward, TRON Basis Shares are distributed to those that provide liquidity to the TRON Basis Cash(TRC)-USDT JustSwap pair, where users can deposit LP tokens to the distribution contract and earn TRON Basis Shares.
The $TBS pool 1 will distribute 750,000 TRON Basis Shares, starting with 6250 TRON Basis Shares and decrease 75% every 30 days.

A further amount of TRON Basis Shares are given to liquidity providers of the TRON Basis Share (TBS)-USDT JustSwap pair, distributing a total of 250,000 TRON Basis Share which lasts for 1 year (365 days). An equal amount of tokens is distributed per day.
